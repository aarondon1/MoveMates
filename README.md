# MoveMates

MoveMates is an application designed to encourage people to walk or bike instead of driving. By completing challenges such as walking a certain number of steps or biking a certain number of miles, users can earn points that they can redeem for rewards at local businesses that support eco-friendly transportation methods.

## Inspiration

The inspiration behind MoveMates is the desire to create cleaner cities. If more people walked or biked, our cities would be less polluted. Not only does walking or biking reduce pollution, but itâ€™s also a fun and healthy activity! This inspired us to build MoveMates to incentivize people to make healthier, environmentally friendly transportation choices.

## Features

- **Challenges**: Users can complete challenges such as walking a certain number of steps or biking a certain number of miles.

- **Backend**: Node.js
